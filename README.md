# Python PPT Notes Extractor: A 3AM Conconction
## An Akash Singh Original: Motivation
In order to avoid having to manually copy paste notes into my e-notebook for courses with slides upto 60 pages. And thankfully because I get access to .pptx
I decided to make a script that will (hopefully) take text from each slide, append it to a .txt file. 
Version 1.2 will hopefully get better at seperating header/body text

## How To Use

Put .pptx file in the same folder as extractorPPT.py and edit input/output file names. Then run script
You can also try it by the sample presentations given
## ToDo

1. ~New paragraph by new bullet not end of line~
2. Bold/alter formatting (may have to go from .txt to .doc??) 
3. Automatically turn to PDF
4. Automate all ".PPTX" files in directory, using some linux magic and turning pyton file to an executable script
